		<p style='font-size:130%'> Mechanical Engineering involves the design, analysis, and 
		manufacture of a wide variety of mechanical components and systems 
		and has been on an integration phase with other disciplines for the
		past few decades offering many challenging career opportunities for the 
		students. The Department of Mechanical Engineering at VJIT was established 
		in 1999 and is accredited by NBA in 2010 and Re-accredited in the year
		2018 for 3 years. The mechanical engineering curriculum is diverse because
		it is central to many modern industries and also because individual 
		mechanical engineers may be employed in a wide range of engineering endeavors
		from initial research and development of a product to manufacturing and 
		marketing. Between these diverse activities, mechanical engineers integrate
		engineering sciences, conceptual product design and manufacturing capabilities 
		into a cost-effective, quality products. Going by the technological advances 
		the Department has been actively engaged in transforming the teaching,
		learning methodology and creating a sound knowledge base in the minds of 
		students. Innovative Teaching tools, Hands on Workshops, Community projects
