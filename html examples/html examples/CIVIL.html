		<p style='font-size:130%'> The Civil Department has firmly stood as one of the colossal
		pillars of the college, it greatly cares for its students to make
		them efficient and competent enough in the field of Civil Engineering 
		and their related concerns as professionals. The Department of Civil
		Engineering at VJIT is established in 2013 and in the very few years 
		of existence has established itself as an inspiring learning center.
		The Department has continuously upgraded itself in terms of academic 
		performance, research and infrastructure as required by the curriculum 
		and the requirements based on industrial need as a result of which our 
		students have been able to develop potential strengths to meet the
		professional and personal challenges prevailing and who can serve in 
		all the possible positions of their respective job domains and contribute
		towards a holistic growth. The Department is transforming to a great
		extent with the diversity that comes with interfacing with other technology 
		domains. The highly qualified faculty team inspires students to do research 
		and train them to address the societal problems while trying to produce
		responsible, competent engineers who can take a lead in nation-building.</p>
